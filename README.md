## How to create an open minting website using the Hyperverse for Ethereum

### Step 1: Get test ETH
- Open your Ethereum wallet of choice. Make sure to adjust your settings so that you are using the Rinkeby test network.

- Go to a faucet website, such as [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby), and send some test ETH to your wallet.

### Step 2: Begin using the Hyperverse!
- Head over to Hyperverse's [documentation](https://docs.hyperverse.dev/). In the [Environment Setup](https://docs.hyperverse.dev/basics/environment) section, you'll see the system requirements you'll need to get started. 

- Follow the steps outlined in the [Using create-next-app](https://docs.hyperverse.dev/basics/environment#using-create-next-app) section of the docs to install and get started.
